# Anthony Dellavecchia's Resume

This is my resume in JSON format.

### Why JSON?

```
Being able to update my resume in a developer friendly format (JSON) is nice because it is one "source of truth".
When I make an update to the JSON, I can display it in multiple styles instead of having to create multiple resumes.
```
This is much more convinient than LaTeX!
