Please feel free to connect and get to know me!\n\nLet's grab some coffee: https://calendly.com/anthonyjdella\n\nAs a UCLA graduate student with a thirst for knowledge, my goal is to develop and improve my skills each day. My attitude and desire to learn is what will help me grow and achieve my goals.\n\nOn December 2016, I received Cum Laude Latin honors, as a college graduate with a degree in Information Technology and Systems from The University of Texas at Dallas. \n\nEarlier that summer, I had a wonderful experience as an ETL developer intern at General Motors Financial. I was able to gain a great deal of business and IT insight, and it helped me discover my passion for data. After the internship program, I was fortunate enough to be promoted to a part-time employee in ETL Production Support. \n\nI previously worked at Bank of America as a software developer, and it helped me discover my love of developing customer-facing applications. I learned about the Financial Center business and the importance of providing a great user experience.\n\nI currently work at State Farm as an object oriented full stack software developer for the renters insurance application on StateFarm.com.\n\nI've had experience in various industries which has broadened my skillset. For instance, as a certified TESOL teacher I learned how to be a leader as I taught, planned, and implemented courses for elementary school students; I've learned customer satisfaction skills and how to communicate effectively as a server/host at multiple restaurants; and working with a small eCommerce company has taught me about the importance of adaptability and process improvement. \n\nI'm very passionate about software development, user experience design, and data.\n\nOutside of work and education, I enjoy: \n✈️ Traveling the world and learning about cultures\n💻 Playing with new technologies\n🎨 Expressing my creative side through art & design\n🏀 Watching sports",
